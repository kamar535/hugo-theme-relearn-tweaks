[Hugo theme Relearn ](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/) tweaks used by my Uppsala university [Introduktion till datorer](https://introduktion-till-datorer.github.io/) pages. 

- The rendering of the main content menu have been tweaked. Each menu entry is rendered using a flex box div with child divs for each part of the entry.  For each entry, this allows for:

  - proper right adjusted wrapping of menu entry titles.
  - inclusions of icons for mandatory assignments, higher grade assignments and higher grade assignment points. 

- The breadcrumbs shows a home icon instead of the name of the site at the start of the bread crumbs. 
- The logo has been updated with the Uppsala university seal.
- Various color changes to the light and dark theme variants. 
- Various minor CSS spacing tweaks.
